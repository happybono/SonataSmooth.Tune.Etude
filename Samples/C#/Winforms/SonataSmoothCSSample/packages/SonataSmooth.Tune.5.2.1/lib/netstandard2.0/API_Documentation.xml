            <remarks>
            The export pipeline is expected to : 
            1. Apply one or more smoothing filters indicated by <see cref="P:SonataSmooth.Tune.Export.CsvScoreRequest.Flags"/>.
            2. Respect boundary handling specified by <see cref="P:SonataSmooth.Tune.Export.CsvScoreRequest.BoundaryMode"/>.
            3. Emit one or multiple CSV files derived from <see cref="P:SonataSmooth.Tune.Export.CsvScoreRequest.BaseFilePath"/>.

            - Append method-specific suffixes if multiple smoothing outputs are generated.

            <summary>
            Positive integer smoothing window radius (half-width). For symmetric kernels

            Commonly : <c>0 &lt;= PolyOrder &lt; (2 * Radius + 1)</c>

            <remarks>
            Choose the smallest order that preserves required peak / derivative fidelity.
            Higher orders increase risk of overfitting noise.

            <summary>
            Optional. Controls the denominator in the Gaussian sigma calculation: sigma = windowSize / sigmaFactor.
            If null (default), legacy behavior is used (sigmaFactor = 6.0). If set, allows custom control of Gaussian smoothing width.
            Applies to both standard and adaptive Gaussian / weighted-median filters.

            Ignored for Rectangular and Savitzky–Golay outputs (they remain full-filter to preserve kernel and polynomial reproduction properties).
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Defaults to 1.0 (full filtered value).
            Use values &lt; 1.0 to retain some original signal and reduce oversmoothing near sharp features.
            High-level writer (CsvScoreWriter) emits the "Alpha Blend" header line only when at least one affected filter is enabled;
            low-level conductor exports (ExportCsvAsync / ExportCsvAsyncFromResults / ExportExcelAsync) always include the Alpha line.
            Ignored for Rectangular and Savitzky–Golay outputs (they remain full-filter to preserve kernel / DC and polynomial reproduction properties).

            Non‑negative derivative order to compute from the smoothed signal.
            0 returns the ordinary smoothed series; 1 the first derivative, 2 the second, etc.
            Only filters that support analytical derivative coefficient generation
            (e.g. Savitzky–Golay) will honor this value; others ignore it.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Constraints / guidance : 
            - Must satisfy : <c>0 &lt;= DerivOrder &lt;= PolyOrder</c> when using a Savitzky–Golay filter
              so that the requested derivative can be represented by the fitted polynomial.
            - Higher derivative orders amplify high‑frequency noise; consider increasing

            - A value of 0 should be treated as "smooth only" (baseline output).
            - Pipelines may emit derivative output in an additional column or replace the
              base series depending on export policy.
            - Downstream validation should reject values greater than <see cref="P:SonataSmooth.Tune.Export.CsvScoreRequest.PolyOrder"/>
              or negative inputs before coefficient generation.

            precedes the comma-separated data columns. Progress (0 – 100) is reported as rows are written and
            cancellation is honored between row writes and file parts.

             <remarks>
             Performance : 
             - Time complexity ≈ O(N * W) where W = (2 * r + 1) for each enabled linear filter;
               the weighted median adds O(W log W) per element due to internal sorting.
             - Parallelization is enabled automatically when N ≥ 2000 (simple threshold heuristic).
            
             Numerical notes : 
             - Gaussian sigma is approximated as (windowSize) / 6 to span ±3σ across the kernel.
             - Savitzky–Golay coefficients are normalized to preserve DC gain (sum = 1).
            
             Boundary handling affects all enabled filters uniformly and can change edge bias.
            
             Safety : 
             - Returned arrays are newly allocated per call; input is not modified.
             - Disabled filters still allocate a result array (filled with default 0.0).

             <remarks>
             Mapping behavior : 
             - Symmetric : Mirrors indices about the edges (e.g., -1→0, -2→1, N→N-1, N+1→N-2).
             - Replicate : Clamps below range to 0 and above range to N-1.
             - ZeroPad : Returns 0.0 for any index outside the range.
            
             Performance : O(1).
            
             Safety : The method does not perform null checks; passing a null array will throw a runtime
             <see cref="T:System.NullReferenceException"/>. Negative lengths are not possible for standard arrays.

             <summary>
             Computes the weighted median of a window centered at <paramref name="center"/> using
             binomial coefficients as weights (robust to outliers compared to a weighted mean).

             <param name="w">Window radius (window size = 2 * w + 1).</param>
             <param name="binom">
             Precomputed binomial coefficient array of length (2 * w + 1); each position supplies the
             integer weight for the corresponding sample offset.
             </param>
             <param name="boundaryMode">
             Boundary strategy used to synthesize samples when the window extends beyond the data range.
             </param>
             <param name="alpha">
             Blend factor validated but NOT applied here (range [0, 1]). This method returns the pure weighted median.
             The caller (ApplySmoothing) applies blending externally : 
             result = alpha * median + (1 - alpha) * originalSample.
             </param>
             <returns>
             The weighted median value. If total weight is zero (degenerate case), returns 0.0.
             For even total cumulative weight, the average of the two middle values (by value order) is returned.
             </returns>
             <remarks>
             Algorithm : 
             1. Gather (value, weight) pairs across offsets [-w, w] applying boundary rules.
             2. Sort by value ascending (O(W log W)).
             3. Traverse accumulating weights until the middle weight position is crossed.
             4. If total weight is even and the cumulative weight equals half exactly, the median
                is the mean of the current and next distinct ordered values.
            
             Complexity : O(W log W) per center (W = 2w + 1).
            
             Robustness : Unlike means, the median resists impulsive spikes inside the window.
            
             Assumptions / Safety : 
             - <paramref name="binom"/> length must equal (2 * w + 1); no defensive length validation is performed.
             - No null checks : invalid inputs yield runtime exceptions (by design for internal / private use).
             - If the collected list is empty (possible only if w &lt; 0 or array length issues), <c>0.0</c> is returned.

             Number of coefficients to generate (row length). Must be between 1 and 63 (inclusive).

             </returns>
             <remarks>
             Usage : 
             - Employed as a normalized (after division by the sum) discrete binomial smoothing kernel.
             - Also reused as integer weights for the weighted median filter.
            
             Rationale for upper bound (63):
             - The sum of the coefficients is 2^(length - 1). For length ≥ 64 this sum would be ≥ 2^63 which
               exceeds the positive range of <see cref="T:System.Int64"/> when combined in later weighted operations.
            
             Complexity : O(length).
            
             Numerical considerations : 
             - Computed iteratively using the multiplicative formula c[i] = c[i-1] * (length - i) / i inside a
               checked context to surface overflow early.
